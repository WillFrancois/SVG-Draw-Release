# SVG Draw
SVG draw is a web application that allows users to draw pictures and export the result into an SVG file.

## What is an SVG?
An SVG (Standard Vector Graphic) is a file format that expresses pictures using mathematical functions such as lines, bezier curves, etc. and creates pictures that are able to be scaled infinitely to any size without loss of fidelity.

## How do I start?
Click the link located underneath the description of the project, click and drag to create a line, and release the mouse button when your line is finished. After, you can save your drawing as an SVG file and put it into a program that can read SVGs such as GIMP, Inkscape, or Adobe Illustrator.

Once imported, you can scale and stroke the result to create rasterized versions in whatever file format you prefer, all without losing fidelity.

## Author's Notes
It is currently not recommended to have additional context menus, such as the developer console, download menu, etc., open while drawing as the lines can become jagged and distorted.
